# PLC-B_and_R-ST-Automation_Studio-visualization-Intersection
Project for a B&amp;R PLC implementing intersection control done in Structured Text (ST) language within Automation Studio environment.

This repository contains a project for a B&R Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) implementing intersection control. The PLC programming is done in Structured Text (ST) language within Automation Studio environment. Along with the PLC logic, the repository includes visualization of the intersection created in Automation Studio for status display and system control.

Repository Contents:

PLC program in Structured Text (ST) for B&R PLC with name PROGRAM_CYCLIC
Complete files of project – intersection control with visualization – for Automation Studio 4.12 stored in a .rar archive with name B&R-Automation_Studio4.12-Visualization-Intersection.rar

This project serves as a demonstration of intersection control implementation using PLC and provides complete source code and visualization files for testing and further study of automation processes.
